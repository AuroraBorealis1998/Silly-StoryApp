The overhead lights in the surgical room highlight the gruesome wound on the patient's abdomen.
She suffered a traumatic avulsion from an unidentified animal and was brought in at 04:12 AM.
Several lacerations can be seen surrounding the main wound and will require stitches.

But, first, we need to clarify who you are before the operation begins. 

*choice
  #I am the patient.
    Earlier today, you were having the worst day of your life. Your partner broke
    up with you, your family couldn't be bothered, and the check you cashed from
    your new job bounced! So, you went for a hike and fell victim to a wild 
    animal attack. Do you remember anything from your hike?
    *choice
      #I didn't notice anything, I was on my phone, and I can't remember what happened.
        Unfortunately, you didn't research the basic tenets of survival. Your
        family had a right to be unimpressed with you. As your spirit watches
        on in horror, the medical student's jittering hand causes air to enter
        your IV. You suffer from an air embolism and fade into the light.
        *finish
      #I noticed the birds had stopped singing... but everything else is blurry.
	  Unfortunately, you didn't act on your gut instinct and run for the
	  hills. As your spirit watches on in horror, the medical student's 
	  jittering hand causes air to enter your IV. You suffer from an air 
	  embolism and fade into the light.
        *finish
      #I was fully aware there was a cougar nearby, and I turned around to face
	it. However, I couldn't get my bear spray out of my backpack quick enough.
        Unfortunately, you didn't go with a hiking partner and now you are
	  at the mercy of an underpaid, overworked medical team. As your spirit 
	  watches on in horror, the medical student's jittering hand causes air 
	  to enter your IV. You suffer from an air embolism and fade into the light.
        *finish
  #I am the anethesiologist. 
    You are bored. Life has been dragging on lately, but you notice the attending
    physician looks new. You wonder if they are paying enough attention to the 
    medical student. Sighing, you...
    *choice
      #Crack a joke at the medical student's expense.
        They blink. This is obviously not the best time to offer sarcasm.
	  Eventually, the medical student is offered a chance at helping the nurse.
	  Something goes wrong! The patient is coding, nurses from other rooms rush
	  in to assist but there is nothing that can be done.
        *finish
      #Return to listening to your audiobook and monitoring your equipment. After all,
	it isn't your job to babysit someone else's medical student.
        You listen to your favorite author, what genre are you listening to?
		#Medical studies, nothing is more important than being good at your job.

		  Of course, how silly of me to ask!
		#Romance, someday I will land a spouse and make a family.
		  *set leadership +10
		  Of course, how silly of me to ask!
		#Horror, nothing beats a worst case scenario like a good horror novel.
		  *set leadership +10
		  Of course, how silly of me to ask!
		#Life hacks and motivational trends. Better to be at my best!
		  *set leadership +10
		  Of course, how silly of me to ask!
        *finish
  #I am the medical student, and this is a teaching hospital.
    The kingdom descends into chaos, but you manage to escape with your own hide.
    Perhaps in time you can return to restore order to this fair land.
    *finish
  #I am the attending surgeon, leading this team.
